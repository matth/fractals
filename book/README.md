Fractals: Images of Chaos
=========================

This is a selection of fractals from the 1987 book [Fractals: Images of Chaos](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fractals-Images-Chaos-Penguin-Science/dp/0140144110) by Hans Lauwerier, which was also published in the US under the name [Fractals: Endlessly Repeated Geometrical Figures](http://www.amazon.com/Fractals-Endlessly-Repeated-Geometrical-Figures/dp/0691024456).

The original code examples in the book are written in Turbo Basic, these examples port that code to [Processing](http://processing.org/). The ports are very much literal interpretations of the basic programs and have not been optimized for the Java / Processing language.
